# Zombie Survival Game

My first program made in Rust.

### Basics

The source is all in one file "src/main.rs"

Use `cargo run` to run the program from source.
`cargo build` builds the source but does not run it and is called 'under the hood' when `cargo run` is invoked.

To build a release version of the program, optimised and without debugging run `cargo build --release`.

Both debug and release versions of programs end up being built into the target folder, under the appropriate subfolder.

### Why I Made This

To help me learn Rust.  The game is dead simple and very dull.  Playing is not the point.
